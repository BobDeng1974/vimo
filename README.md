# VIMO
## Visual-Inertial Model-based State and External Forces Estimator

![factor_graph](./support_files/image/factor_graph.png)

VIMO is a visual-inertial state and force estimator for multicopters. It incorporates robot's dynamic model in an optimization-based visual-inertial odometry system, such as [VINS-Mono](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421746?arnumber=8421746&source=authoralert), to additionally provide external force estimates. Similar to IMU pre-integration, it preintegrates collective thrust generated by the propellors to form dynamic factors which, together with IMU factors, help distinguish between commanded motion and external disturbance.

If you use VIMO in an academic context, please cite the following paper:

**VIMO: Simultaneous Visual Inertial Model-based Odometry and Force Estimation**, Barza Nisar, Philipp Foehn, Davide Falanga, Davide Scaramuzza (RSS/IEEE-RAL, 2019), [pdf](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RSS19_Nisar.pdf)

## 1. Prerequisites
1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
Ubuntu  16.04 or newer
ROS Kinetic or newer. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
additional ROS pacakge
```
    sudo apt-get install ros-YOUR_DISTRO-cv-bridge ros-YOUR_DISTRO-tf ros-YOUR_DISTRO-message-filters ros-YOUR_DISTRO-image-transport
```

1.2. **Ceres Solver**
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html), remember to **make install**.
(Our testing environment: Ubuntu 18.04.3, ROS Melodic, OpenCV 3.4.9, Eigen 3.3.4) 

## 2. Build VIMO on ROS
Clone the repository and catkin_make:
```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/vimo.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

**Note: Current VIMO version fails if control commands are zero.** Therefore, it is recommended to run it offline on datasets and ros bags. 

## 3. VIMO on Public datasets
We can only run VIMO on datasets that contain motor speeds or control commands. One such dataset is [Blackbird Dataset](https://github.com/mit-fast/Blackbird-Dataset). We tested VIMO on Blackbird's **star** and **picasso** sequences. Settings to run VIMO on Blackbird dataset are in **blackbird** branch.

```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src/vimo
    git checkout blackbird
    cd ../..
    catkin_make
```

Open three terminals, launch the vimo_estimator, rviz and play the bag file respectively. Take star_maxSpeed1p0 for example
```
    roslaunch vimo_estimator vimo.launch 
    roslaunch vimo_estimator vins_rviz.launch
    rosbag play YOUR_PATH_TO_DATASET/star_maxSpeed1p0.bag YOUR_PATH_TO_DATASET/star_maxSpeed1p0_images.bag 
```

<!-- (Optional) Visualize ground truth. A naive benchmark publisher from [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) can help you visualize the ground truth. It uses a naive strategy to align VIMO with ground truth. Just for visualization. not for quantitative comparison on academic publications.
```
    roslaunch benchmark_publisher publish.launch  sequence_name:=star
```
 (Green line is VIMO result, red line is ground truth). -->
